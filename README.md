### Installation

The `requirements.txt` file will handle most of the dependencies, but some of them are a bit trickier.

* FIt-SNE: requires FFTW (http://www.fftw.org/) to be installed. For OSX you can use `brew install fftw`.

* OptSNE: requires GCC 8 to be installed. For OSX you can use `brew install gcc@8`.
